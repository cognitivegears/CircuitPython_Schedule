## CircuitPython Schedule

The CircuitPython_Schedule module is based on the excellent [schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/) CPython module by [Dan Bader](https://pypi.org/user/dbader/), modified for CircuitPython by [Nathan Byrd](https://github.com/cognitivegears).  This open-source module facilitates the execution of functions on fixed time schedules. This is particularly useful in CircuitPython for use cases involving time-based activities; some activities could include watering plants, turning on/off lights, periodically logging data or sending reminders, among many others. The library uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to allow for flexible scheduling options at execution time.

### Installation
